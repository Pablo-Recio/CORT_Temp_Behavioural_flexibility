## Introduction

Cognition is defined as the processes by which animals gather, preserve, and use information from their environment through perception, learning, memory, and decision making [@shettleworth]. These cognitive processes underpin several aspects of animals' ecology such as foraging, mate choice, antipredatory strategies, and/or social behaviours, that are crucial for the survival and reproduction of animals [@dukas_evolutionary_2004]. Particularly, learning - the acquisition of neuronal representations of new information [@dukas_evolutionary_2004] - is seen as fundamental for coping with environmental changes by enabling individuals to create new associations between events [@dukas_evolutionary_2004; @leal_behavioural_2012; @buchanan_condition_2013]. However, in nature, there is individual variation in the capacity to acquire new information, influenced by factors like age, sex, gut microbiota, or the environment where they develop [@szuran_water_1994; @lemaire_prenatal_2000; @zhu_prenatal_2004; @amiel_hotter_2012; @amiel_egg_2014; @carazo_sex_2014; @noble_age-dependent_2014; @alemohammad_2022_microbiota_learning]. In particular, early life conditions can play a pivotal role since the brain is especially susceptible to environmental influences during early stages of development [@zhu_prenatal_2004]. Therefore, investigating the effects of the developmental environment on learning can be essential to understand how individual variation in learning is shaped, and, in consequence, to predict animals' responses towards environmental change.  
In this sense, prenatal Glucocorticoids (GCs) - hormones related to organisms' response to stress [@sapolsky_how_2000] - and prenatal thermal environment are known to influence learning abilities in different taxa [see @lemaire_prenatal_2000; @zhu_prenatal_2004; @amiel_hotter_2012; @amiel_egg_2014; @crino_corticosterone_2014; @abayarathna_effects_2020]. For instance, some studies have demonstrated that prenatal stress and high prenatal GC levels impair learning [@lemaire_prenatal_2000; @zhu_prenatal_2004; @farrell_developmental_2015-learn], while others showed diverse effects depending on factors like subjects' sex or the nature of the learning task [@szuran_water_1994; @crino_corticosterone_2014-learn; @farrell_developmental_2015-learn; @bebus_associative_2016]. Similarly, some experiments have shown significant impacts of prenatal temperature on learning in ectotherms [@amiel_hotter_2012; @amiel_egg_2014; @dayananda_incubation_2017; @abayarathna_effects_2020]. For example, high incubation temperatures have been linked with faster learning rates in skinks [@amiel_hotter_2012; @amiel_egg_2014], while velvet geckos incubated at temperatures over their natural range learn slower than those incubated within the natural thermal limits [@abayarathna_effects_2020]. In this vein, the effect of prenatal temperature appears to be linked to alterations in neural structure and metabolic activity [@coomber_independent_1997; @sakata_neural_2000; @amiel_effects_2017; @beltran_are_2021] that share some similarities with those resulting from prenatal increased stress or GC levels [@lemaire_prenatal_2000; @zhu_prenatal_2004; @du_dynamic_2009]. This suggests that prenatal GCs and temperature can act on the same physiological mechanisms and, thus, both could interact to shape individual variation in learning abilities [@noble_developmental_2018]. Furthermore, GCs can play an pivotal role in determining vertebrate responses to elevated temperatures [@Crino_2023] potentially fostering natural interactions between temperature and GCs. However, despite the proximate similarities of prenatal GCs and temperature effects, and the potential role of GCs in vertebrates' response to elevated temperatures, our understanding of how these two factors interact remains incomplete.  
In this study, our objective is to explore the interactive effects between prenatal Glucocorticoids (GCs) and the prenatal thermal environment on learning. We utilized two species of skinks, the delicate skink (_Lampropholis delicata_) and the common garden skink (_L. guichenoti_), as model species. We experimentally increased Corticosterone (CORT) - the main GC in birds, reptiles, amphibians, and rodents [@Crino_2023] - levels in the eggs of these two species of skinks and then incubated them at two different temperatures in a 2X2 factorial design. Post-incubation, the juveniles were subjectd to a colour-associative and a reversal task to assess their learning abilities. Our hypothesis posits that changes in CORT levels and temperature during early development will induce sustained effects on brain's physiology that will ultimately impact learning skills. We predict that individuals exposed to high levels of CORT and/or low temperatures will perform less proficiently in both learning tasks compared to control individuals or those exposed to high temperatures. Additionally, we anticipate that incubation at high temperatures will mitigate the impact of CORT on skink performance, while cold incubation temperatures are expected to enhance the detrimental effects of CORT on learning. We also expect the treatments to affect both tasks equally, with those individuals exposed to high levels of CORT and/or low temperatures performing less proficiently in both tasks compared to control individuals or those exposed to high temperatures. Finally, we expect that the effects of the treatments will be similar in both species, as both species share similar life history traits and are closely related [@chapple_know_2011; @chapple_biology_2014], and other cognitive studies have not found any difference between species when tested in an associative learning task [@bezzina2014does].  

## Methods  
We employed juveniles of both species, _L. delicata_ and _L. guichenoti_ that came from a breeding colony kept in the lab (details of breeding colony and husbandry in Supplementary Material). Those individuals were treated with prenatal CORT or vehicle, and incubated at different temperatures (see Supplementary Material), but previous data demonstrated that there was no differences in learning skills caused by these treatments (**REF**).
To estimate behavioural flexibility, we examined lizards' performance in a learning task and its reversal (**REF**) using colour as the main conditioned stimulus and food as a reward (see @fig-Methods). There was first a habituation phase where lizards had to learn to eat from white 3D-printed PLA ramps (9 L x 4 W x 5 H cm); then a second phase where lizards had to associate the attainability of food with one colour; and finally a reversal task where the colour associated with attainable food was changed (@fig-Methods B). We evaluated the correlation between performance in the associative and reversal task as the main estimate of behavioural flexibility.  
The habituation phase was divided into three stages: in the first stage, the reward, a small, frozen cricket (*A. domestica*) was placed in an opaque petri dish (3D x 1.6H cm) (@fig-Methods B, Stage 1); in the second stage, the petri dish with the cricket was placed on top of the white 3D printed ramps (@fig-Methods B, Stage 2); and in the third stage, the cricket was left inside a well (3D x 1.75H cm) on the top of the ramp (Fig. @fig-Methods B, Stage 3). Trials in every stage lasted one hour, begining when the feeding block (petri dish, ramp, or both) was placed inside the enclosure and finished when we took the feeding block away. We recorded whether the cricket had been consumed or not and we considered an stage as completed if the lizards ate the crickets in at least 5 out of 6 trials. This phase lasted 38 days, and only in one case we decided not to use the lizard in the next phases because its behaviour was not consistent.  
In the associative phase, we used three ramps that were identical in shape and size but differ in the colour (Associative task in Fig. @fig-Methods B). As in the last stage of the habituation phase, we placed the cricket inside the wells of the ramps, but then two of them were covered with 3D-printed lids (3D x 0.5H cm) so prey was only accessible in "the correct" ramp. The food reward was placed in all three wells to avoid lizard using prey chemical cues, that were released in the closed wells thanks to a series of small holes on the top of the lids. The colours of the feeders were green, red, and blue, as previous studies demonstrate that squamates can discriminate between these colours [@Baden_Osorio_2019_Vert_vision]. However, we decided to split the lizards in two groups to control for potential colour preference that could bias our results. One group of lizards was assigned the blue ramp as the correct choice (i.e., the ramp with the non-covered frozen cricket) in the associative task and the red ramp in the reversal, while the other group was assigned red as correct for the associative and blue for the reversal. In all trials, the position of the feeders was changed randomly to ensure subjects were using colour rather than spatial cues for the association. Lizards were tested in this task once a day for 35 days. After the colour association phase, we performed a choice reversal task (Reversal task in @fig-Methods B). Here, the attainability of prey was indicated by a different colour from the reversal, requiring the lizards to form a novel association between the new colour and the food reward. This test was done once a day for 40 days.  
We performed the full experiment was between the 6^th^ of March until the 26^th^ of June 2023, between 11 to 12 am, when the lizards were active. Trials in the learning phases (colour associative task and reversal tasks) were recorded with different CCTV systems always using the same camera per individual. Videos were analysed manually using a standard video player (IINA) by PR, who recorded whether the first choice made by each subject was the correct feeder or not. A choice was considered to be made if the head of the lizard was inside the well of one of the ramps. We considered a trial failed if there was no choice in one hour of recording and those trials were considered as 'non data' in the analyses. We excluded from our analyses those individuals with more than 15 trials failed (i.e. they did not make a choice), and we considered the first trial to be the first one where the individual made a choice. We also considered individuals to be reinforced if the cricket was eaten after the test independently of whether their initial choice was correct or not.

#### Statistical analyses  


**As such, we run a total of different 8 models employing Bayesian multilevel models using the brm function from the brms package (@burkner2017brms) in Quarto (@Allaire_Quarto_2022). Each model consisted of four parallel chains of 3000 iterations, with a warm up interval of 1000 iterations.'Choice', i.e. whether the individual chose correct (1) or not (0) was used as the response variable. The fixed effects of the model included a triple interaction between: trial ('Associative trial' or 'Reversal trial') as a numeric variable, and hormone treatmet ('CORT' versus 'Control') and the temperature at which eggs were incubated ('Cold' versus 'Hot') as factors. For the random effects, we employed lizard identity as a random intercept, and as a random slope we included the variable trial ('Associative' or 'Reversal') within each level of lizard identity. We used the resulting posterior of these models to evaluate learning differences between treatments within and between species and colour assigned. More specifically, we calculated learning slopes by using the estimates of the trial variable per each level of the hormone-temperature interaction ('Treatments'); values bigger from zero were considered as evidence of learning, while those less or equal to zero not. We used the pmcmc method to test whether those slopes or the comparissons between 'Treatments' (e.g. slope for 'CORT-Cold' lizards minus 'CORT-Hot' lizards) were different from zero (two-tailed tests). We considered statistical significance if p-value < 0.05.**

#### Colour preference in the Associative task
To test if lizards were biased towards the assigned colour as our preliminary analyses suggested, we employed the intercepts  from our posterior distributions. We first estimated the predicted probability of choosing the correct feeder first in the first trial, by using the formula: 
$$\text{Probability} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-Intercept}}$$

Second, we tested the hypothesis that the estimated probability was higher than 0.33 (the probability expected by chance of choosing the correct feeder) using pmcmc. If the estimated probability is above 0.33. we consider it as an indication that there was a preference towards that colour that could be affecting learning slopes. The results per treatment are summarized in @tbl-bias.

#### Husbandry  
*Breeding colony* -- We tested juveniles coming from a breeding colony established in the lab since 2019. There is a total of 270 and 180 adults of *L. delicata* and *L. guichenoti* respectively, housed in big containers (41.5 L x 30.5 W x 21 H cm) with six lizards (2 males and 4 females) per enclosure. Enclosures are provided with non-stick matting, shelter, and several small water dishes. Water is given daily, and they are fed approx. 40 mid-size crickets (*Acheta domestica*) per enclosure three days a week. Crickets are dusted with calcium weekly and multivitamin and calcium biweekly. To ensure a temperature gradient, we employ a heat chord and a heat lamp following a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle. Room temperatures are set to 22-24 Celsius, and warm side of enclosures is usually at 32 Celsius.  
*Eggs collection and incubation* -- Between mid-October 2022 to the end of February 2023, we provided females with a place to lay the eggs by means of small boxes (12.5 L x 8.3 W x 5 H cm) with moist vermiculite inside, that were placed in one extreme of the communal enclosures (see above). We checked for the presence of eggs in the boxes three days a week. After collection, we measured length and width of eggs with a digital caliper to the nearest 0.1 mm and weight them with a (OHAUS, Model spx123) digital scale Â± 0.001g error. Then eggs were treated with CORT or vehicle (see CORT and Temperature manipulation below) and were placed in individual cups (80 mL) with moist vermiculite (12 parts water to 4 parts vermiculite). The cups were covered with cling wrap to retain moisture and left in LATWIT 2X5D-R1160 incubators at two different temperatures (see CORT and Temperature manipulation below) until hatching.  
*Hatchlings* -- Eggs in the incubator were checked three times a week for hatchlings. After hatchling, we measured juveniles' SVL and Tail Length (TL) with a rule to the nearest mm and weighted them with a (OHAUS, Model spx123) digital scale Â± 0.001g error. We then placed hatchlings in individual enclosures (18.7L x 13.2W x 6.3H cm) and provided them with non-stick matting and a small water dish. During this period, they were sprayed water every day and received 3-6 small *A. domestica* crickets three times a week. All care otherwise follows similar protocols to adults (see above).  
Two weeks before we started the training phase (see below), lizards were moved to the experimental arena for acclimatation. The arenas were individual medium size (41 L x 29.7 W x 22 H cm) plastic containers with a shelter (9 L x 6 W x 1.5 H cm) on one of the extremes and a water dish on the other. These new enclosures were placed in two rooms in 7 different racks associated to 7 different CCTV systems (device model DVR-HP210475) that allowed us to record their behaviour during the experiment (see details below). The number of lizards per species and treatment in each rack was counterbalanced to control for any effect of the room or the position of the lizard in the rack. During acclimatation and all the experiment, lizards were fed with only one cricket per day dusted with calcium and multivitamin (see protocol below), and water was supplied *ad libitum*. We provided a temperature gradient by means of a heat cord and heat lamps in a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle. The rooms temperature was set to between 22-24 Celsius.  

#### CORT and Temperature manipulation  
To test empirically the effect of early environment we manipulated CORT concentration in eggs and incubated them under one of two temperature regimes ('Cold' -- 23ÂºC Â± 3ÂºC or 'Hot' -- 30ÂºC Â± 3ÂºC) in a 2x2 factorial design (@fig-Methods A). We first allocated eggs to one of two different treatments: CORT treatment, where eggs were topically supplied with 5ÂµL of CORT dissolved in 70% Ethanol and 30% DMSO (vehicle) at a final (10 pg CORT/mL) concentration (CORT treatment); and a Control treatment, where eggs received an equal volume of the vehicle. CORT concentration employed in the CORT treatment represents 2 standard deviations above the mean natural concentration obtained in eggs from both species (non-published data). Then, eggs were incubated in one of the two previously mentioned temperature regimes ('Cold' or 'Hot') until hatching. The number of eggs per clutch assigned to each hormone and temperature treatment were counterbalanced in both species.
